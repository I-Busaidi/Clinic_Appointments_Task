# Clinic Appointments Task

This repo contains a hospital system which has clinics, patients, and appointments.
The system allows patients to view clinics and then book an appointment if they choose to do so, and the clinic has allocated appointment slots that will determine how many patients can book an appointment per day.

The system includes the following functions:
1. Add clinic.
2. View clinic.
3. Add patient.
4. View patient.
5. Book appointment.
6. View patient appointments.
7. View clinic appointments.

More functionality will be added over time.
